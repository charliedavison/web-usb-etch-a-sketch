# web-usb-etch-a-sketch
A saturday morning project - HTML5 canvas Etch a sketch with support for printing to a thermal printer via WebUSB or Node server.

Inspired by a talk at FFConf Brighton by Suz Hinton (@noopkat).

# How?

- npm install
- npm start
- Open src/client/index.html in a browser

May require some settings changes in `/src/server/print.js` to work with your specific printer/system setup.
